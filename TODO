Basic to Comabt:

While Still Fighting:
  Determine Init per person
  Generate list of who goes first (init + weapon speed)
  Go through the list of Units and determine their action
  Repeat

1: Determine surprised
2: Determine Distance
3: Figure out Initiative
4: Handle Round
5: Figure out resultures per side
6: Continue each round by initative until one party fless or dies

Initative = 1d6 + weapon speed
 Lowest   = First to go
 If more then 1 attack, attack after everyones first attack.

Breaking Off From Melee:
 Allows attack one free attack action (such from the rear)

Attack From Flank:
 Negagte Sheild Bouns

Attack From the Rear:
 +2 to hit, negate shield and dex bonus

Attack to a stunned, prone, motionless opponets:
  Same as rear attack expect +4 to hit

Magically Sleeping/Held:
  Automatically Hit, and max damage possible


WHAT DO I NEED PER THINGS:
- AttackSpeed
- ArmorClass
- DexterityBouns // Special cases for flanking/rear attacks
- ShieldBouns    // Special cases for flanking/rear attacks
- Health
- WeaponRange

Size     Speed
--------------
Tiny        +0
Small       +3
Medium      +3
Large       +6
Huge        +9
Gargantuan  +12


Need to know about ENGAGED creates... ie. if a create leaves an engagement the other gets a free attack (maybe?)
Maybe this should just be a check every time a character attempts to move.
  ie. Move from cell 0,0 to 0,1 but there was a creater in 1,0 who now gets a free hit

Main Battle Loop/Engament:
while StillFighting():
  Generate list of attacks for the round (NEED TO DO THIS PER ROUND) <---- Need a list of both sides

int group1_init = d6.Roll();
int group2_init = d6.Roll();
